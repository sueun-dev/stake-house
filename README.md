## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- MetaMask browser extension
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stake-house.git
   cd stake-house
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your environment:
   - Update contract addresses in `js/soliditycontract/configchainnetwork.js` if needed
   - Ensure MetaMask is set up with the correct network (Ethereum mainnet or testnet)

### Backend Infrastructure

1. Initialize the server environment with advanced configuration:
   ```
   cd server && npm install --production=false
   ```
   This installs both production and development dependencies for full ecosystem support.

2. Configure the environment with secure credentials:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env && nano .env
   ```
   Set up your MongoDB Atlas connection string, Web3 provider URL, and security parameters.

3. Initialize the database schema and indexes:
   ```
   npm run db:init
   ```
   This creates optimized indexes for high-performance queries and initializes time-series collections.

4. Start the production server with PM2 process management:
   ```
   npm run start:production
   ```
   This launches the Node.js cluster with automatic load balancing, memory optimization, and process monitoring.

5. Monitor real-time server performance:
   ```
   npm run monitor
   ```
   Access the server dashboard at http://localhost:3000/status with real-time analytics.

### Running the Application

#### Development Server

1. Start a local HTTP server:
   ```
   npx http-server -p 8080
   ```
   or
   ```
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080/Gomz_Club/nft.html`

3. **Important**: MetaMask extension must be installed and connected to the application to use all features
   - Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the application
   - Approve the connection request in MetaMask
   - Ensure you have ETH in your wallet for minting and transaction fees

## Smart Contract Deployment

If you want to deploy the contracts to a testnet or mainnet:

1. Install Truffle:
   ```
   npm install -g truffle
   ```

2. Configure your deployment settings in `truffle-config.js`

3. Deploy the contracts:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network [network_name]
   ```

4. Update the contract addresses in `js/soliditycontract/configchainnetwork.js`

## Transaction Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**: User connects their MetaMask wallet
2. **Mint NFT**: User mints a new NFT by paying ETH
3. **Stake NFT**: User stakes their NFT by sending it to the staking contract
4. **Earn Rewards**: Staked NFTs generate $SH tokens over time
5. **Claim Rewards**: User claims their earned $SH tokens
6. **Unstake NFT**: User can unstake their NFT at any time

## Key JavaScript Functions

- `ERC721.fMintWithETH()`: Handles NFT minting
- `ERC721.stakingTransaction()`: Generic function for staking contract interactions
- `ERC721.stake()`, `ERC721.unstake()`, `ERC721.claim1()`: Specific contract interaction functions
- `ERC721.showMyNFTs()`, `ERC721.stakegetMetadata()`: Display functions for owned and staked NFTs

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Web3.js
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask
